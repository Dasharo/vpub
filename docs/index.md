  <b>coreboot flash party is here!</b>
</h1>

<h2 align="left" style="color: #38d430;">
  <b>Heard about open-source firmware and coreboot but did not dare to try?</b>
</h2>

You couldn't find better place to know more about open-source firmware and
coreboot and why you should try it.

The very first 3mdeb's public and open hackathon is here with coreboot as its
main theme. coreboot is an extended firmware platform that provides instant and
secure booting of modern computers and embedded systems. As an open source
project, it provides auditability and maximum control over the
technology.

But enough talking... Visit the hackathon to see coreboot in action because
there is no better way of befriending coreboot than real interaction.

<h2 align="left" style="color: #38d430;">
  <b>Have a good oldie to flash but afraid to break something?</b>
</h2>

Don't worry... The hackathon will be organized in the form of workshop where
you will learn how to flash coreboot on various hardware platforms using DYI
and professional tools.

Also a team of experts will be watching over your hardware safety at any time.
And if anything goes wrong (it sometimes just happen) we will recover it from
bricked state.

So do not hesitate and bring your platform with you, we will help analyze your
hardware and feasibility of coreboot flashing.

<h2 align="left" style="color: #38d430;">
  <b>I already have coreboot on my machine and don't want to waste my time on the hackathon</b>
</h2>

You have coreboot on your machine, really? That's great news! But we encourage
you to come anyway. With almost 100% certainty your corebooted machine firmware
can become even better and we will show you numerous ways how you can improve
it.

Slowly getting interested? Good... Want more? Then come hack with us!

  <b>The goal of the hackathon</b>
</h3>

As an active contributor and promoter of the open-source Dasharo firmware, the
3mdeb Team wants to familiarize attendees with the process of providing
coreboot support for the selected platforms. For this part of the event, 3mdeb
will provide the necessary hardware and tools.
