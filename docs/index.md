The main theme of this year's hackathon will be coreboot. coreboot is an
extended firmware platform that provides instant and secure booting of
modern computers and embedded systems. As an open source project, it provides
auditability and maximum control over the technology.

Hackathon will be organized in the form of workshop where you will learn how to
flash coreboot on various hardware platforms using DYI and professional tools.
Also bring your own laptop. We will analyze your hardware and feasibility of
coreboot flashing. Don't worry! We can recover it if anything will go wrong.

As an active contributor and promoter of the open-source Dasharo firmware,
the 3mdeb Team wants to familiarize attendees with the process of providing
coreboot support for the selected platform (more information in the near
future). For this part of the event, 3mdeb will provide the necessary hardware.
