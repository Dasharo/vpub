The main theme of this year's hackathon will be coreboot. coreboot is an
extended firmware platform that provides instant and secure booting of
modern computers and embedded systems. As an open source project, it provides
auditability and maximum control over the technology.

As an active contributor and promoter of open-source firmware, the 3mdeb Team
wants to familiarize participants with coreboot. You can also participate in
providing support for the selected platform (more information in the near
future).

3mdeb will provide the hardware needed to participate in the event. Bring
your own hardware as well. If we find that it is already supported in the
coreboot tree, we will be happy to flash coreboot on your device.
During the event there will be soft drinks and beer, as well as small snacks.
