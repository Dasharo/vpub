# Project Demo session backlog

Project Demos are up to10min open-source firmware, hardware, and open instruction
set architecture (OSF/HW/ISA) related demo sessions every hour. In the past, we accepted:
* OSF/OSHW/OpenISA projects development, debugging, and validation demos.
* OSF/OSHW/OpenISA projects status presentations.
* Presentation about OSF funding, sponsoring, bug bounty, and business models.
* Hardware and firmware certification presentations.
* OSF/OSHW/OpenISA conference announcements and advertising.
* OSF/OSHW/OpenISA programs announcements and advertising.

### Based on reddit [discussion](https://www.reddit.com/r/RISCV/comments/srg945/vpub_v4_opensource_online_party_17_february_at_8/) with [omasanori](https://www.reddit.com/user/omasanori/)
- [ ] [RustSBI](https://github.com/rustsbi/rustsbi) - maybe u/CyReVolt know what is community opinion, especially Ron, about this repo, maybe even someone tried it.
- [ ] [qspimux](https://github.com/felixheld/qspimux) - we know Felix for quite some time and used that project in [ASUS KGPE-D16 compatible Dasharo firmware](https://docs.dasharo.com/variants/asus_kgpe_d16/setup/#spi).  I will mention that project when we will get to KGPE-D16 during the vPub.
- [ ] [lnDSO150](https://github.com/mean00/lnDSO150) - never heard about this one, thanks for the reference. Maybe u/mean00 could jump in and talk little bit about this cool project at future vPub? I also noticed that GigaDevice seem to have STM replacements. I wonder if they have the same supply chain issues.
- [ ] [bcm5719-fw](https://github.com/meklort/bcm5719-fw) - I saw announcement of this project on [Raptor Forum](https://forums.raptorcs.com/index.php/topic,305.0.html). I will ask melrott, if there is intrest in introducing project at vPub.
