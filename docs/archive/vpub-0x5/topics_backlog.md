# Free-form discussion topics backlog

Main value of vPub always for free-form discussion, because of that we would
like to keep as long as possible list of potential topics that could be of
interest for vPub community.

##  [vPub #4 agenda](archive/vpub-0x4.md)

### Twitter

- [X] Richard started discussion about simplified and scalable way of building
firmware [here](https://twitter.com/hughsient/status/1491021628079153154).

### FOSDEM 2022 after-party notes

- [X] OST2: Reward system: forum to discuss with creators:
vPub/NFT - Xeno approved idea of forum, but it will take some
time to set it up.

## Backlog

### Matrix

#### From Andrew

- [ ] `<troll>No QR code on the image</troll>` - we should discuss that at some
  point.

#### From Thierry

The discussion as of now needs to be really practical in what the FSF can
actively promote for KGPE-D16 and extend that to libre design and absence of
blobs, otherwise it gets complicated. Will edit this post with key points.

RMS suggested:

- [ ] Can you send a brief list of the concrete helpful things that the FSF
should do?
- [ ] One is to ask the developers of Coreboot to keep the support for the
KGPE-D16, never to drop it, explaining that it is the one and only x86
server board that respects users' freedom.
- [ ] What else should I ask the FSF to do?

We can work on above during OSF vPub and note brainstorming results.
